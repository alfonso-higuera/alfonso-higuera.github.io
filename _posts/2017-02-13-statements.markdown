**Definition**: A _statement_ is a sentence that is determinately true or determinately
false independently of the circumstances in which it is used, independently of speaker,
audience, time, place, and conversational context.

Since a statement must be either true or false, it must be a declarative sentence. But not all declarative sentences are statements. E.g. "I'm hungry" is a declarative sentence but its truthfulness depends on speaker and time.

In what follows we will suppose that all the sentences presented as examples can be
paraphased to statements uniformly.

Compound statements can be formed by combining statements using conectives like "_and_", "_or_",
"_not_", and "_if ... then_". For example:

- Alice is a daydreamer and the Hatter is mad.
- If Columbus discovered America then today is Friday.
- The house is painted blue or my name is Albert.
- I will not go to the meeting tonight.

For some statements there exist an interdependency with repect of their truthfulness. For example,
the sentences "It is raining" and "It is not raining" can not both be true. Indeed, if one is true
the other must be false, and vice versa. This interdependence is the basis for logical
argumentation.

The truth of a compund statement depends on the truth of its constituent statements. We will se how
this is the case, for each of the logical conectives stated above, in further posts.
