**Definition**: A _statement_ is a sentence that is determinately true or determinately
false independently of the circumstances in which it is used, independently of speaker,
audience, time, place, and conversational context.

Since a statement must be either true or false, it must be a declarative sentence. But
not all declarative sentences are statements. E.g. "I'm hungry" is a declarative sentence
but its truthfulness depends on speaker and time.

In what follows we will suppose that all the sentences presented as examples can be
paraphrased to statements uniformly.

Compound statements can be formed by combining statements using connectives like
"_and_", "_or_", "_not_", and "_if ... then_". For example:

- Alice is a daydreamer _**and**_ the Hatter is mad.
- _**If**_ Columbus discovered America _**then**_ today is Friday.
- The house is painted blue _**or**_ my name is Albert.
- I will _**not**_ go to the meeting tonight.

For some statements there exist an interdependency with respect of their truthfulness. As
an example, the sentences "It is raining" and "It is not raining" can not both be true.
Indeed, if one is true the other must be false, and vice versa. This interdependence is
the basis for logical argumentation.

The truth of a compound statement depends on the truth of its constituent statements. We
will se how this is the case, for each of the logical connectives stated above, in further
posts.

Two statements are said to be equivalent if they are true in exactly the same cases.
